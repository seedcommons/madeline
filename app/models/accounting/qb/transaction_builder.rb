# TransactionBuilder is responsible for building Quickbooks JournalEntry objects from Madeline Transactions.
# Note that these JournalEntrys may or may not already exist in Quickbooks. This is because we
# need a fully initialized JournalEntry object to perform both creates AND updates via the Quickbooks API.
# This class is NOT responsible for running the actual create/update operation via the API.
#
# However, it may initiate API calls while getting references for customer (QB equivalent for Organization),
# department (QB equivalent for Division), and class (QB equivalent for Loan) if corresponding
# objects don't exist yet in Quickbooks.
